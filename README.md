# Individual Assignment 3

In this assignment, a Choropleth map was implemented to represent products sold by country from an [Online Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufdelikkaya/online-sales-dataset).

In order to map an interactive hover effect, a [geoJson dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/D3-graph-gallery/master/DATA/world.geojson) was also required.
